# riot engine
RIOT engine is a general-purpose cross-platform game engine supporting multiple rendering pipelines such as Direct3D, Vulkan, and more.

RIOT is a proprietary game engine shared for my convenience and to showcase my work. Some code sections are not included here because areas of the code base use proprietary code from platforms that require NDA and, for legal reasons, can not be published publicly. The end goal of this repo is to showcase code and to be used as a learning resource.

### Supported Platforms

- Linux
- MacOS
- iPhone (planned)
